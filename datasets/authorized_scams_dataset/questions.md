2.  **Transaction Confirmation (Initial):**

**I. For Feedback Collection (Post-Resolution)**

*   "To help us improve ABC fraud detection, can you confirm if this alert was a true fraud incident or a legitimate transaction?"
*   "What was the final outcome of this transaction with ABC?"

**Important Considerations for Agent Implementation:**

*   **Context-Driven Selection:** The Dialogue Agent must intelligently select which specific questions to ask based on the `Rule ID` and the presence/absence of other relevant context (e.g., `UserContext`, `DeviceContext`).
*   **Logical Flow:** Questions should follow a natural conversational progression (e.g., identity verification first, then transaction specifics, then deeper probing based on scam indicators).
*   **Templating:** Use placeholders like `[Amount]`, `[Recipient]`, `[Entity]` that are dynamically filled from the `TransactionContext` or other relevant contexts.
*   **No Hallucinations:** The agent should ONLY draw questions from the pre-defined ABC SOP rules and conversation samples. It should not generate new, unverified questions.
*   **Adaptive Questioning:** If a customer's answer resolves the suspicion (e.g., "Yes, that's my new phone and I logged in with ABC biometrics"), the agent should pivot to closing the inquiry or escalate as per the ABC SOP, rather than asking irrelevant follow-up questions.

**Enhanced Risk Assessment Questions:**

*   **Digital Literacy Assessment:** "How comfortable are you with online banking and security features?"
*   **Device Verification:** "Can you confirm if you're using your usual device for ABC banking?"
*   **Location Verification:** "Are you currently in [Location] where this transaction originated?"
*   **Behavioral Pattern:** "Is this transaction amount and timing consistent with your usual ABC banking behavior?"
*   **Education Material:** "Have you completed ABC's scam education materials recently?"
